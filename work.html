					<div class="about-me-text">
						<p>I've been lucky enough to work in a variety of industries in the past few years. Having acquired my first software internship over the summer of 2017/18, I have gained knowledge and experience in the latest and relevant software practices.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I have had a history of working in various engineering disciplines. I was working on a construction site as a civil engineering intern in the summer of 2016/17, and before that worked as a set fabricator for a brief time on the set of the action/thriller film Meg (2018).</p>
						<br>
						<p>I have a passion for computer programming and have gained a huge amount of knowledge from working professionally, as well as working on my own personal projects. Some skills I have acquired through academic and professional practice, and others I have taken the effort to learn in my own time. I particularly enjoy working with C# and .NET, of which I have been heavily exposed to at my internship at Serko Ltd.</p>

					<h2 class="work-company-name">Serko Ltd.</h2>
					<img class="serko-image" src="http://www.serko.com/media/1585/iphone-serko-travel-screens.png?width=500&height=319.1666666666667">
					<p class="serko-text">Beginning in late 2017, my time at Serko has been spent working in a team of two other interns on a singular project guided by the company’s chief technical officer. Our project would have us integrating additional third-party server flight information into Serko Online’s search functionality and booking system. A huge amount of knowledge gained in part II software engineering was called upon and strengthened during the experience, and I have gained huge insight into understanding the methodology of developing and deploying software for large legacy systems.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="serko-text">This was the first year Serko offered any formal internship program. Because of this the company was interested in developing their recruitment strategy’s and building relationships with university students. A goal of the program on Serko’s behalf was that our team would provide important feedback on the hiring process and work environment. A further result of the programs adolescence was the freedom and independence we were given as a team, and we were treated like fully fledged developers throughout our time working for Serko.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="serko-text">A cornerstone product of Serko, Serko Online is a powerful cloud-based web interface that allows users to search, filter and book corporate business trips through their company. To achieve optimum search coverage, Serko Online sends requests to multiple online application programming interfaces (API’s) and collates the responses into data displayed on the website. Requests and responses to and from various API’s come in vastly different formats, so a transformation of data must occur from the API to a standardized format that Serko Online can read, and vice-versa. We would be writing these two-way transformation processes for a specified third-party API. All data send and received was in the XML data form.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="serko-text">Technologies I was required to work with include C#, .NET, Unity, NUnit, MOQ and visual studio.</p>

				<div class="china-hawkins">
					<h2 class="work-company-name">China / Hawkins Construction</h2>
					<img class="china-hawkins-image" src="https://media.barfoot.co.nz/ListingPhotos/high/552976.jpg?width=845&height=560&mode=Crop&quality=65&scale=canvas">
					<p class="china-hawkins-text">I was working as an intern under China construction at the Park Hyatt Hotel construction site located at 141 Hasley St, Westhaven in the summer of 2016/17. The hotel promises to be one of Auckland's premiere hotels, located at the waterfront in Wynyard Quarter.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="china-hawkins-text">I was given the task of inspecting ground beams and slab pours, where I used a variety of technologies including theodolites and laser measurers. My duties also included using electronic machinery such as power drills, sabre saws, and jackhammers. I would also contribute content to the bi-weekly progress report in the form of documentation photos or computer generated diagrams.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="china-hawkins-text">This job exposed me to the processes and techniques implemented in a real-life large scale engineering project. Both China Construction and Hawkins Construction are huge players in the structural engineering industry, and it was an honor to work under them both as an intern. Many engineering lessons I learned here I believe I can apply to almost any facet of my future professional career, and  would like to thank my supervisors and colleagues for their kindness and hospitality.</p>

					<h2 class="work-company-name">Meg(2018)</h2>
					<img class="meg-image" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KFU0U_EA3V8/maxresdefault.jpg">
					<p class="meg-text">Over the inter-semester break of university in 2016 I was offered the opportunity to work on site of a Hollywood blockbuster Meg. The film centers around a prehistoric megalodon being re-awoken in the depths of the ocean, and returning to terrorize the coasts of the world.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="meg-text">On the project I would be working in the set fabrication department, specifically, helping build the interior set of a submarine. I would again be gaining hands on parctical experience on an engineering project, as I would be using tools such as drills, saws and soldering irons. I was also tasked with wiring up ligting circuitry for the set and testing that the lighting was operational.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="meg-text">If I were to mention one thing this job taught me was the importance of hard work and self motivation. The film industry is not easy to work in, with long days, early hours, physically exhausting work and at times mind numbing tasks. It was an unforgettable experience, and I thank everyone who did their best to make sure I learned as much as I could.</p>
