1) Open the TataiApp directory in terminal

2) run the command "java -jar Tatai.jar

"

### REQUIREMENTS
* Linux Machine
* HTK
* Bash Shell

### HOW TO EXECUTE
If JavaFX is not 
already installed on your machine, execute the command "sudo apt install openjfx" 
in a terminal. 


Note: Due to how the working directory is set Tatai must be launched from the command line
in its current configuration. For double cick run capabilities, move the TataiData directory
to ~.
